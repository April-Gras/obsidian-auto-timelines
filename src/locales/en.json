For example if your custom regex pulls the year month and day out of a date, the natural order should be \"year,month,day\". Note that you should have as many entries as your regex has capture groups. See presets for inspiration.",

To customize this you can either use the more user friendly flow by pressing start or just edit the values yourself by hand. Worst case scenario you can also reset to default in the advanced section."
